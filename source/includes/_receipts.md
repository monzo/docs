# Receipts

Receipts are line-item purchase data added to a transaction. They contain all the information about the purchase, including the products you bought, any taxes that were added on, and how you paid. They can also contain extra details about the merchant you spent money at, such as how to contact them, but this may not appear in the app yet.

This is the API currently used by [Flux](https://monzo.com/blog/2019/01/31/flux-monzo-launch/) to show receipts at selected retailers in your Monzo app.

Items detail each product that was included in the transaction. They let you see more detailed data in your Monzo feed than just how much you spent! 🎉

Items can be made up of sub-items, for example an extra topping on a burger. Sub-items have the same format as items (but they cannot in turn have their own sub-items!). The amounts of the sub-items should add up to amount on the item.

All of the items together, plus the taxes, should add up to the Receipt total.

Payments tell us how you paid for your purchase. While it will always include a card payment, sometimes a cash payment or a gift card is included as well. All of the payments together should add up to the Receipt total.

The payment details might not appear in the app just yet.

## Create a receipt

```shell
$ http PUT "https://api.monzo.com/transaction-receipts" \
    "Authorization: Bearer $access_token" \
    # ... JSON Receipt data ...
```

```json
{
  "transaction_id": "tx_00...", 
  "external_id": "test-receipt-1",
  "total": 1299,
  "currency": "GBP",
  "items": [
    {
      "description": "Bananas, 70p per kg",
      "quantity": 18.56,
      "unit": "kg",
      "amount": 70,
      "currency": "GBP"
    }
  ]
}
```

To attach a receipt to a transaction, make a `PUT` request to the `/transaction-receipts` API. Your request should include a body containing the receipt encoded as JSON.

<aside class="notice">
Unlike our earlier APIs, this API takes a JSON-encoded request body, rather than a form-encoded body.
</aside>

If you’re successful, you’ll get back a `200 OK` HTTP response, along with the `receipt_id` and the rest of the information you provided, repeated back to you. After that, the receipt will show up in your Monzo app!
