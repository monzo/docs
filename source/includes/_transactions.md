# Transactions

Transactions are movements of funds into or out of an account. Negative transactions represent debits (ie. *spending* money) and positive transactions represent credits (ie. *receiving* money).

Most properties on transactions are self-explanatory. We'll eventually get around to documenting them all, but in the meantime let's discuss the most interesting/confusing ones:

##### Properties

<span class="hide">Property</span> | <span class="hide">Description</span>
-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------
`amount`         | The amount of the transaction in minor units of `currency`. For example pennies in the case of GBP. A negative amount indicates a debit (most card transactions will have a negative amount)
`decline_reason` | **This is only present on declined transactions!** Valid values are `INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS`, `CARD_INACTIVE`, `CARD_BLOCKED`, `INVALID_CVC` or `OTHER`.
`is_load`        | Top-ups to an account are represented as transactions with a positive amount and `is_load = true`. Other transactions such as refunds, reversals or chargebacks may have a positive amount but `is_load = false`
`settled`        | The timestamp at which the transaction [settled](http://blog.unibulmerchantservices.com/authorization-clearing-and-settlement-of-mastercard-transactions/). In most cases, this happens 24-48 hours after `created`. If this field is an empty string, the transaction is authorised but not yet "complete."
`category`       | The category can be set for each transaction by the user. Over time we learn which merchant goes in which category and auto-assign the category of a transaction. If the user hasn't set a category, we'll return the default category of the merchant on this transactions. Top-ups have category `mondo`. Valid values are `general`, `eating_out`, `expenses`, `transport`, `cash`, `bills`, `entertainment`, `shopping`, `holidays`, `groceries`.
`merchant`       | This contains the `merchant_id` of the merchant that this transaction was made at. If you pass `?expand[]=merchant` in your request URL, it will contain lots of information about the merchant.

## Retrieve transaction

Returns a list of transactions on the user's account. 

<aside class="warning">
<strong>Strong Customer Authentication</strong><br/>
After a user has authenticated, your client can fetch all of their transactions, and after 5 minutes, it can only sync the last 90 days of transactions. 
If you need the user‚Äôs entire transaction history, you should consider fetching and storing it right after authentication.
</aside>

<aside class="notice">
The list transactions API currently only supports transactions for Current Accounts and Flex Accounts.
