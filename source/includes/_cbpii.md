## Dynamic Client Registration

We have implemented the `POST /register` endpoint in version 3.2 of the Open Banking Dynamic Client Registration specification. You can find the [full specification here](https://openbanking.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DZ/pages/1078034771/Dynamic+Client+Registration+-+v3.2).

You can find the appropriate URL and supported configuration in our [well-known endpoints](#well-known-endpoints) for each environment.

## Authentication
As per the Open Banking specification, we use OAuth 2 and OpenID connect for authentication. We have implemented the 
redirect flow, with authentication taking place in the customer's Monzo app.

We only support the `tls_client_auth` authentication method.

## Confirmation of Funds
We have implemented version 3.1.10 of the [Open Banking Confirmation of Funds Specification](https://openbankinguk.github.io/read-write-api-site3/v3.1.10/profiles/confirmation-of-funds-api-profile.html).

We use the **redirection flow** for approving consents.

You can identify a `DebtorAccount` using the `UK.OBIE.SortCodeAccountNumber` scheme. We'll return an error for any 
other `SchemeName`.

<aside class="info">
<strong>Strong Customer Authentication and Confirmation of Funds (CBPII)</strong><br/>
Monzo will apply Strong Customer Authentication the first time we authenticate a customer for Confirmation of Funds
(CBPII) consents. Since access is limited to information about the customer's balance, consents can be ongoing 
and do <b>not</b> require the customer to regularly re-authenticate.
